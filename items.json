{"content": "In our Opencast mine Shovel-dumper combination is used for excavation of overburden and ore. During rainy season, due to nickli-ferrous-limonite  present in the overburden material, the haul roads  become too slippery, making it difficult for dumpers  to maintain operation under control and ply normally. Additionally, the dumper operation on unstable slope causes damage to the tyres, which results in the increased load on the maintenance work. Keeping the safety precautions in line, the movement of equipment is stopped during rain/drizzle. This leads to productivity loss during rainy season. To continue the operations during rainy seasons, haul roads are covered with morum/quartz/HUB. These material are overspread manually on the haul roads. \u00a0  However, this method is not sustainable owing to   non-availability of sufficient quantity of material for covering, frequent changes in the layout of haul roads, as new faces  are being developed and operated.   Additional factors affecting safety of the haul roads are:   Jet of water washing down the benches, during rainy reason, washes down the slippery material  on the haul road, this sticks and keeps on accumulating on the chains, tyres and adjoining portions of Dumper. Consequently, the grip of the tyres reduces causing unsafe plying conditions Making drainage facilities  is not possible in the mines and this leads to piling up of materials that are slippery in nature   Therefore, we are looking for solutions, which will facilitate the movement of mining equipment and normal operation of mines during rainy seasons  The solutions must meet the following requirements:   It should allow mining operations during drizzle/rain/downpour   All chain/tyre mounted mobile equipment shall be able to move on the haul roads   Shall comply to mining statutory requirements   Shall be economical   Shall not hamper mining during non-rainy days   The suggested solution should facilitate/sustain the movement of mining equipment such as shovel/dumper/dozer/Grader  \u00a0  Additional information about the surrounding nature of soil   Limonite: RMR  <, Slippery in rainy season Surpentinite: RMR< , Circular failure in rainy season Dolorite: RMR very less, Circular Failure in rainy season Hard Hub: RMR> , Prone to tyre cut   Additional information about the machines/vehicles moving on the haul roads   Excavator , Dumper , Grader , Loader  and Dozer    \u00a0You may like to refer to this link for more details: ", "_id": "94", "title": "Enabling Operation of Opencast Mine During Rainy Season"}
{"content": "Diamond is a naturally occurring gemstone and is renowned as a material with supreme physical qualities, e.g. peculiar optical dispersion, as it originates from the strong covalent interaction between its atoms. The diamond studded gold jewellery is one of the most preferred ornaments by women on all occasions. In jewellery manufacturing, diamonds made of different sizes ranging from . mm are used in studded gold jewellery. However, during the process, keeping a vigilance on misuse and pilferage of diamond has been a great challenge due to its small size. It is known that, due to the electro-magnetic induction property, any precious metal such as gold or platinum can be easily detected using the metal detector and thereby prevented from theft within the reach of scannable distance of few centimeters. Because of non-existence of such electro-magnetic property, the precious gems like diamond are not easily detectable using any conventional technique like metal detector or scanning facility. In this scenario, the possibility of diamond going missing is highly likely.  The challenge is to develop a device/detector which can be used to scan a person or a container for loose diamond detection. The device should be capable enough to detect diamonds of size ranging from .mm to  mm in different shapes such as round, oval, princess, marquise, pear, radiant etc. At present, the pilferage of diamond is monitored only through accounting based system and realization of loss occurs only at a later stage during stock audit. To encounter these challenges, we seek suitable solution that will keep in place a fool-proof and non-destructive system for proper scanning and detection of pilferage of diamonds.   Options tried to solve before:   Accounting based system to monitor loss/ pilferage - is a gross measure and is highlighted only during stock audit.   Future state:   Fool-proof system for diamond detection to prevent losses and pilferage.   Success criteria:    High efficiency in detection of diamonds of different sizes and shapes. Safe detection process and fulfil the requirements of occupational, health and environmental safety standards .", "_id": "99", "title": "Identification of diamond using hand held detector"}
{"content": "Paint, in various colors, paint chemistries and textures, is applied on steel substrates using continuous production. \u00a0The wet painted substrate is heated after application in ovens to cure the paint and remove the solvent, so the temperature of the painted substrate alters as the process continues. This is important since the paint color also changes depending on the temperature. \u00a0Most of the time two paint layers are applied, one after the other. It is also to be noted that dry film physical properties are not identical and the different paint formulations are color specific .  The substrate surface onto which the paint is applied could be Hot Dip Galvanised, Galvalloy, Magizinc or cold reduced steel, where the substrate surface is typically MB or MC according to EN with a typical roughness of . - . Ra measured by a cut-off of .mm. The dry paint thickness varies from  to  microns and the line speed at which paint is applied is max  m/min.  Color, gloss and paint thickness are critical parameters that need to be controlled tightly to ensure homogeneity and product quality. \u00a0To measure coating properties samples are taken from the coated sheet, but it takes time to cut a sample from the production line and check the color, gloss and thickness using off line equipment.  The accuracy required for measurement of various parameters is the following:   Thickness measurement - \u00a0+/-. microns Colour measurements - +/-. deviation in dL, da and db using Cielab or Hunter equations Gloss variation measurement - +/- .\u00b0.\u00a0   The greatest challenge is also to measure accurately the in-line paint thickness of our thickest coatings - PVC  micron, to within an accuracy of +/- . micron. These measurements are also only spot checks so variation in properties isn't picked up till the next off-line measurement.  The production process begins without any initial testing and relies on operator experience to set up the \u201cpaint coater head\u201d to get the correct finish. By the time the painted sample is cut at the exit of the line, any deviation from standard, affects a large amount of production that has already been made. To ensure better process control and greater consistency in product properties, it is very desirable to have an online color, gloss and thickness measurement machine, in a single device.  There are online color, gloss and thickness measurement technologies already on the market for carrying out these tests, however there is no technology/device that can carry out all these measurements together in a single unit. The ideal measurement technique should be non-destructive. Currently, the color measurement industry uses / geometry color machines. \u00a0There are also various online dry film thickness machines. Examples of these are CO\u00a0laser, Beta scatter and Laser Displacement devices. Gloss measurement techniques are currently based on EN-:, \u00b0.  Solutions are invited for a machine/technology that will measure all the parameters: color deviation, gloss and dry film thickness, online & in one unit. In the first phase, this machine/technology will be deployed to measure these parameters for solid colors, followed by metallic shades and ultimately textured paint surfaces.  \u00a0  The solution must meet the following requirements:   Measure and display color deviation, dry film thickness and gloss Measurement must be performed online and all these parameters must be measured in a single unit It should be as small as possible and should be suitable to use in an industrial environment. \u00a0 When the solution is deployed, the calibration should be performed automatically. During color deviation measurement, it must measure the temperature and normalize the results to room temperature. \u00a0 A full system including measuring equipment, moving support arm, and data control and communication, should not cost more than \u00a3k, per production line.", "_id": "85", "title": "Method for online measurement of color deviation, gloss and thickness of painted coating on metal substrate"}
{"content": "The refining of pure gold from lower Karatage gold  involves various operations such as preparation, melting, refining and granulation, which requires typically  h for completion. The process time followed for the entire gold recovery operation is considerably high and therefore needs the intervention of process specialists to reduce the lead time. In the context of refining, the traditional aqua regia  method is used to refine pure gold  from Karat  and Karat  obtained through exchange of gold by the customers and factory scrap. However, the corrosive nature, occupational and environmental hazards pertaining to storage, handling and disposal of aqua regia make the refining process more critical from the perspectives of people safety and scale-up. Therefore, suitable solutions are invited to develop an eco-friendly route to extract gold, as an alternate for aqua regia based treatment process.\u00a0   Options tried to solve before:   Pyrometallurgical process was tried earlier to selectively oxidize the impurity elements such as copper, zinc etc. and recover pure gold from low Karatage gold.
